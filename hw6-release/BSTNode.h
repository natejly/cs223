/**
 * Binary Search Tree Node. A BSTNode is a node in a binary search tree, which
 *  is a binary tree with the following properties:
 *  - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than
 *      the node's value
 *  - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater
 *      than the node's value
 *  - The left and right subtree are each also be a binary search tree
 *
 * A BSTNode also has the following (private) properties, some of which have an
 *  associated (public) getter function, but no setter function. These
 *  properties are:
 *  - data is the value of this node
 *  - count is the number of times the data has been inserted into the
 *      tree (minus the number of times it has been removed from the tree)
 *  - height is the height of the node within the tree, increasing
 *      from leaf (0) up to the root.
 *  - left, right are the (possibly NULL) pointers to the left and right
 *      children, respectively
 *  - parent is the (possibly NULL) pointer to the parent node
 *
 * If the BSTNode represents an empty tree, then its properties are:
 *  - data = [unspecified]
 *  - count = 0
 *  - height = -1
 *  - left, right = nullptr
 *  - parent = [unspecified]
 *
 * The BSTNode class also has the following public methods:
 *  - minimum_value() returns the node with the minimum value in the tree
 *  - maximum_value() returns the node with the maximum value in the tree
 *  - search(int value) returns the node with the given value in the tree
 *  - bst_insert(int value) inserts a value into the tree
 *  - avl_insert(int value) inserts a value into the tree
 *  - rbt_insert(int value) inserts a value into the tree
 *  - bst_remove(int value) removes a value from the tree
 *  - avl_remove(int value) removes a value from the tree
 *  - rbt_remove(int value) removes a value from the tree
 *  - node_count() returns the number of non-empty nodes in the tree
 *  - count_total() returns the total of all counts in the tree
 *  - is_empty() returns true iff the tree is empty
