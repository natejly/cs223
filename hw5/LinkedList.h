/**
 * Class for a linked list of Islands. The (abstract) state of a LinkedList is
 *  a sequence of Islands.
 * Besides this itself (which is a sequence of Islands), there are two
 *  (abstract) properties of a LinkedList:
 *      this.length
 *          the number of Islands in the list
 *      this.currPos
 *          a cursor into the list, which is NULL if it has never been used or
 *          if it has just been reset or if it has traveled past the end of the
 *          list. Otherwise it is an island that is in the list.
 *
 * TODO: The above comment describes the ABSTRACT state of a list. The CONCRETE
 *  state (i.e., the private members) may differ slightly, significantly, or
 *  not at all. Describe the "abstraction function" for this list: how does a
 *  particular set of values of the private members translate to an abstract
 *  value? Importantly: in which order do the nodes of the linked list map to
 *  the sequence in the abstract state?
 * NOTE: This is part of an optional additional activity.
 *
 * Abstraction Function: The abstraction function for my implementation is the same as 
 * the description above where this.length keeps track of the number of islands and this.currPos
 * represents the cursor pointing to an island at our the current location.
